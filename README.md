# XX-CLI

`xx-cli` is a scaffolding solution that includes project initialization, Git integration, ONE-click deployment of OSS and CDN.

## Why?

In the process of our development, we often encounter some repetitive labor. Repeated labor is prone to errors and redundant workload. We use scaffolding to reduce the workload due to human reasons and allow more time for development. Do meaningful things.

npm install -g @xx1115/cli
